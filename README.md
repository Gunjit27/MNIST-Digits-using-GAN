# GAN for Image Generation with TensorFlow

This project is a practical implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow, designed for image generation. GANs are a prominent class of neural networks that consists of two critical components: a generator and a discriminator. In a competitive setting, the generator aims to produce authentic-looking images, while the discriminator strives to distinguish genuine images from the artificially generated ones.

## Overview

GANs have gained significant attention in the deep learning community due to their remarkable capability to create data that closely resembles real-world samples. In this project, we explore the application of GANs in generating images, with a specific focus on producing hand-drawn digit images.

## Key Features

- **Image Generation**: The core functionality of this project is to train a GAN to generate images. By leveraging the MNIST dataset, the GAN is designed to produce hand-drawn digit images that mimic human handwriting.

- **TensorFlow Implementation**: The project is built upon the TensorFlow framework, which is well-known for its capabilities in developing deep learning models. The TensorFlow ecosystem provides a robust foundation for creating and training GANs.

- **Training and Progress Visualization**: The project includes training routines for both the generator and discriminator networks. It also visualizes the training progress, allowing users to monitor how the generated images evolve over time.

- **Animated Progress Visualization**: An animated GIF is generated during training, offering an engaging and informative way to observe the GAN's learning process. This GIF encapsulates the transformation of the generated images as training advances.

## Usage
