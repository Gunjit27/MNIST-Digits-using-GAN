# MNIST-Digits-using-GAN
This project leverages TensorFlow to build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image generation. GANs involve two neural networks: a generator creating realistic images and a discriminator discerning real from generated ones. This implementation concentrates on generating hand-drawn digit images.
